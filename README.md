## Task: Bank loan classification

#### Description: 
I was given a dataset of the bank loans and was tasked to build a machine-learning model that can accurately classify whether the personal loan was accepted or not based on the information provided. I also had to create a chatbot so that the users could easily access the ML model and get their bank loan acceptance predicted by entering pertinent details.

You can run the chat bot by executing the following command in the project directory from a bash terminal.<br>
<code>python .\chat_bot.py</code>

#### Dataset: 
You can view the dataset initially provided to me in the <code>New Bank_loan_data.xlsx</code> file with the following columns. A basic description of each column is given below: 
- ID: ID of the customer 
- Age: Age of the customer
- Gender: M for Male, F for Female and O for Others
- Experience: Amount of work experience in years
- Income: Amount of annual income (in thousands)
- Home Ownership: Home Owner, Rent and Home Mortgage. 
- Zipcode: Postal code in which the client lives
- Family: Number of family members
- CCAvg: Average monthly spending with the credit card (in thousands) 
- Education: Education level (1: bachelor's degree, 2: master's degree, 3: advanced/professional degree) 
- Mortgage: Value of home mortgage, if any (in thousands) 
- Securities Account: Does the customer have a securities account with the bank?
